# 🎧 LOOMIX MUSIC PLAYER

A single-file, production-ready **Glassmorphism** music player application built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern front-end design techniques within a self-contained structure.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT USAGE NOTICE:**
This code is provided strictly for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. It uses placeholder audio/image URLs and hardcoded data structures. **DO NOT** deploy this application to a production environment or a public-facing server without significant modification, including securing file paths, implementing robust backend support, and updating copyright information.

## ✨ Features Implemented

This single-file application includes a full Single Page Application (SPA) structure with:
- **Modern Glassmorphism UI**: Extensive use of `backdrop-filter: blur()` and colored glows.
- **Full Navigation**: Home, Search (with filtering), Library (with tabs for Playlists/Artists), Liked Songs, and Custom Playlist Details.
- **Persistence**: Uses `localStorage` for saving volume preference, liked songs, and custom playlists.
- **Audio Controls**: Play/Pause, Next/Previous, Shuffle, Repeat modes, Volume control, and Progress Seeking.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fully optimized layout for tablets and mobile devices, including a sliding sidebar menu.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Space (Play/Pause), Arrow Keys (Seek/Volume), N (Next), P (Previous).
